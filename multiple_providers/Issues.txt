  [Low] S3 server access logging is disabled
  Info:    S3 server access logging is disabled. Enabling server access logging
           provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a S3
           bucket. This information is useful for security and compliance
           auditing purposes.
  Rule:    https://snyk.io/security-rules/cloud/SNYK-CC-00021
  Path:    aws_s3_bucket > uswest_bucket
  File:    main.tf:1
  Resolve: For AWS provider < v4.0.0, add `logging` block attribute. For AWS
           provider >= v4.0.0, add `aws_s3_bucket_logging` resource.

  [Low] S3 bucket object-level logging for write events is disabled
  Info:    S3 bucket object-level logging for write events is disabled.
           Object-level S3 events (GetObject, DeleteObject, and PutObject) are
           not logged by default, though this is recommended from a security
           best practices perspective for buckets that contain sensitive data.
  Rule:    https://snyk.io/security-rules/cloud/SNYK-CC-00111

  [Low] S3 bucket replication (cross-region or same-region) is not enabled
  Info:    S3 bucket replication (cross-region or same-region) is not enabled.
           Cross-Region S3 replication can help with meeting compliance
           requirements, minimizing latency, and increasing operational
           efficiency. Same-Region S3 replication can help with aggregating logs
           and compliance with data sovereignty laws.
  Rule:    https://snyk.io/security-rules/cloud/SNYK-CC-00177
  Path:    aws_s3_bucket > uswest_bucket
  File:    main.tf:1
  Resolve: Configure a `replication_configuration` block that specifies an IAM
           role for replicating objects and rules managing the replication.

  Info:    S3 bucket MFA delete control is disabled. S3 bucket will not enforce
           MFA login on delete requests.

           `true`.

Medium Severity Issues: 4

  [Medium] S3 bucket is not encrypted
  Info:    S3 bucket is not encrypted. Enabling server-side encryption (SSE) on
           S3 buckets at the object level protects data at rest and helps
           prevent the breach of sensitive information assets. Objects can be
           encrypted with S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3), KMS Managed Keys (SSE-KMS),
           or Customer Provided Keys (SSE-C).

  [Medium] S3 bucket policy does not deny requests that use HTTP
  Info:    S3 bucket policy does not deny requests that use HTTP. To protect
           data in transit, an S3 bucket policy should deny all HTTP requests to
           its objects and allow only HTTPS requests. HTTPS uses Transport Layer
           Security (TLS) to encrypt data, which preserves integrity and
           prevents tampering.

  Path:    aws_s3_bucket > euwest_bucket
  File:    main.tf:10
  Resolve: Configure the `aws_s3_bucket` `policy` field or the
